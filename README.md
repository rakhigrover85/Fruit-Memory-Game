#User Experience

User stories are brief descriptions of a feature from the perspective of the user. For a Game website, we can outline the following user stories based on different user goals:

#Colour Scheme

![colors and pics used](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abbc9cfd-0411-44d2-bd77-322732598611)

Given the relaxing nature of the topic, I aimed to maintain a minimal and dark color scheme to avoid overwhelming kids. I used basic, famous colors like blue orange gradiant for header in the CSS to create a fun time experience for kids. The codes for the colors used are as follows:
•	Body (Background Color): rgb(16, 99, 129)
•	Header/Text: linear-gradient(45deg, orange 15%, red 35%, yellow 80%);
•	Container: rgb(21, 214, 224)
•	Reset and Start Button(Background-colour): #0bad26;
•	Reset and Start Button(Text colour): White 

#Typography
I have used fonts arial, sans-sariff and Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma as back up. Font sizes i have chosen 3 rem 2 rem and 1 rem.

#Wireframes
Wireframes were created for Main Design stays same when screen changes its size.

Known bugs

There is still one bug in the game. After clicking on both apple cards they flip back again. They should not. Other cards are working fine. 

When friends tested the site they found that very rarely a game will get stuck on a card.
